                Intro to Web is designed to both teach you the skills, and foster connections. Intro also offers more flexibility as a part-time, evening course; It covers most of the introductory topics used in our more 
                intensive Bootcamp program, but at a more manageable pace. It'll help you build a solid foundation in web development using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And if you don't even know what those are...
