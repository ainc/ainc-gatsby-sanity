                a: [<p>The Coding Club is designed for students ages 9-17. Please inquire if your student doesn't fit that age range but you still want him/her to participate - <a href={`mailto:learn@awesomeinc.org`} className='link--brand'>learn@awesomeinc.org</a> </p>]

                a: [<p>Yes. Each student will need to provide his/her own laptop for the course. Microsoft Windows-based PC's, Apple macOS computers, or Google Chromebooks will work, but iPads will not work for this course. We recommend a laptop made within the past 3-4 years. Computers should be free from viruses/malware. We have a very limited number of rental laptops available for $25/day, which can be <a href='https://checkout.square.site/buy/6HJGQL5ZSKMETXTUWRFONC4J' className='link--brand'>reserved online</a>.</p>]

                q: "How often can my student attend Coding Club?",
                a: [<p>Your student can attend twice a week. Our Coding Coaches will be available to students all throughout the week if your student has questions while working outside of class time.</p>]

                a: [<p>Awesome Inc U is devoted to teaching coding skills. It's never too early or too late to learn how to code. You don't have to be a genius to learn to code, you just need to be determined. Check out what some of our <a href='' className='link--brand'>past students have to say!</a></p>]
