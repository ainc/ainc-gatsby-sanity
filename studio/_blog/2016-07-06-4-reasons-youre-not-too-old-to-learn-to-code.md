*"Learning to write programs stretches your mind, and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains."*  - Bill Gates

It's difficult to read a blog without coming across an article stating the importance of teaching kids to code. In fact, it's been said that learning to code is as essential to a successful start in life as reading, writing, and math. But who says only children should learn to code? Here are 4 reasons you should give coding a shot regardless of your age or career path.

**1.  Learning to code can make you more productive, efficient, and creative**

Creativity is often thought of as a right-brained function but programming helps engage both hemispheres. Writing and debugging code are basic problem-solving activities, and a benefit of programming is learning how to break a problem down into small, solvable parts. As you learn to code, creativity naturally evolves. Confidence is gained with each successful outcome, enabling you to begin testing and connecting ideas with new solutions.

**2.  We need more programmers**

Over the next ten years, programming will be one of the fastest growing occupations. Programming positions currently offer a median wage of $79,390, more than double the average of $35,540 for all occupations. There will be 1.4 million programming jobs unfilled with only 400,000 graduates in Computer Science! Can we afford to wait for our children to plug the gap?

Fortunately, for less than the cost of one semester in a CS degree program, you can develop programming skills at a[ coding bootcamp](http://www.awesomeincu.com/bootcamp/) and be on your way to earning [$75-80K upon graduation](https://www.coursereport.com/reports/2015-coding-bootcamp-job-placement-demographics-report). 

**3.  It's fun and easy to learn**

Though coding is certainly logic-based, it's creative and exciting. When you know how to code, the possibilities are endless. With just a computer, you can develop programs and apps that you care about. Start learning a language like JavaScript, Ruby, Python, or Java and you could make your life easier, while having fun!** **

**4.  Coding languages are the foundation of our interconnected world**

The 'Learn To Code' movement has certainly picked up steam in the past year, but itâ€™s important to note that "code" is not something new. What is new is that we have a strong incentive to learn a particular type of code: billions of people now have Internet-connected computing devices, which we carry around with us wherever we go, and we spend an increasing amount of time using these devices. If we want to interact with these people and influence these people, then we have to learn to communicate with the code (in this case, computer code) that gets their attention.

Fortunately, many apps and[ programs](http://www.awesomeincu.com/) have been created to help learners, both young and old. So, where should you begin?

* [Free online options](http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/9-places-you-can-learn-how-to-code-for-free.html) can be accessed at home, such as Khan Academy, MIT open courseware, Codecademy, and many others.

* Learn to code with [Awesome Inc U](http://www.awesomeincu.com/adults/)'s Intro To Web Development or Developer Bootcamp courses.

* Have a child interested in code? Sign them up for an immersive experience such as Awesome Inc U's[ Week of Code Summer Camp](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/week-of-code-summer-camp-august-lexington-tickets-21394811457).

* [Programming Tutorials From Made With Code by Google](https://www.madewithcode.com/): Google's Made With Code project has a mission of encouraging girls to pursue careers in computer science. The Made With Code projects are easy to follow and designed for both intermediate and beginner coders.
